# Rig Symphony

This is `RigCodeAI/symphony`, a fork of OpenAI Symphony and the implementation repository
for Rig's **Factory Setup** project. We are extending the existing Elixir coordinator
into a software factory for the separate `RigCodeAI/rig` repository.

The intended flow is a delegated Linear issue → implementation → trusted validation →
one linked PR → independent review and bounded fixes → human merge in GitHub → archive
and cleanup. This is the target design, not a claim that the factory is deployed.

## Start here

- **Working agents:** read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), then
  [elixir/AGENTS.md](elixir/AGENTS.md) for Elixir work.
- **Current scope and acceptance criteria:** read the
  [Factory Setup project](https://linear.app/rigai/project/factory-setup-a2dff7721c28/overview)
  and the assigned ticket, including dependencies and discussion.
- **Existing service contract:** [SPEC.md](SPEC.md).
- **Current implementation, setup and tests:** [elixir/README.md](elixir/README.md).

Factory Setup tickets change this repository. The factory being built will execute Rig
coding tasks in separate workspaces; do not confuse the repositories or run factory
coding sessions inside this service's source checkout.

## Current foundation and planned additions

The existing implementation provides tracker polling, bounded scheduling, isolated issue
workspaces, local/SSH workers, Codex app-server execution, retries, reconciliation and a
runtime dashboard. See the Elixir README for its current behavior and limitations.

Factory Setup adds file-defined workstreams, durable run/stage records, native Linear
delegation and questions, trusted validation and PR publication, independent reviews,
permanent evidence, and reproducible GCP deployment. Check current code and ticket
evidence before treating any planned addition as available.

Workstreams define stages and inline gates. Agent definitions select instructions,
models and runtime permissions; skills supply reusable procedures. Evaluators return
evidence, and the service enforces gates. There is no separate agent-profile object or
reusable gate registry in the initial design.

The first increments are:

1. [DEV-229](https://linear.app/rigai/issue/DEV-229): run a local file-defined agent stage
   followed by an executable check, proving passing and failing gates. This demo needs
   neither cloud infrastructure, Linear integration, Daybreak nor publication.
2. [DEV-232](https://linear.app/rigai/issue/DEV-232): durable local runs/stages, restart
   recovery and human waits. See [the controlled recovery demo](docs/durable-workstreams.md).
3. Bind deployment, delegation, validation, publication, review and cleanup to those
   stages through the remaining tickets. Integrate Coverage Factory's separate contracts
   and qualify capacity after the pilot works.

Native Linear webhook intake and durable routing are available for controlled local tests.
See [Linear delegation](docs/linear-delegation.md) for configuration and the remaining live
app, endpoint and worker requirements. No live delegation acceptance is claimed.
The [contained worker control path](docs/contained-worker-operations.md) includes reviewable
SSH/systemd installation files and remains disabled until worker qualification passes.
The local deployment wiring supports the existing systemd 252 worker, selected coordinator
credentials and a separate signed webhook listener. See the [morning decision card](docs/dev-233-morning-decision.md)
for live prerequisites; no worker installation or public ingress is claimed.

Use live ticket dependencies to schedule work. The local files
`docs/rig-software-factory-spec.md` and `docs/factory-setup-ticket-drafts.md`, if present,
are earlier drafts. They predate the workstream additions and published ticket updates;
their profile terminology and unpublished-ticket notes are stale. They are background,
not the current task queue.

## Build and test the existing service

From this checkout, with [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) installed:

```bash
cd elixir
mise trust
mise install
mise exec -- mix setup
mise exec -- mix build
mise exec -- make all
```

The pinned runtime is in [elixir/mise.toml](elixir/mise.toml). `make all` runs setup,
build, format checks, lint, test coverage and Dialyzer. See the Elixir README for focused
tests and opt-in live integration tests, which create external resources.

To run the existing service, provide an explicitly configured workflow from `elixir/`:

```bash
mise exec -- ./bin/symphony /absolute/path/to/configured/WORKFLOW.md
```

**Do not use [elixir/WORKFLOW.md](elixir/WORKFLOW.md) unchanged for Factory Setup.** It is
an upstream example with an upstream project/clone, different Linear statuses, rework
that closes the old PR, an agent-driven merge path, and a cleanup hook that can close
PRs. The factory design instead preserves one PR, waits for a human GitHub merge, and
requires archival before cleanup. Documentation changes do not change that sample's
runtime behavior. Existing workflow compatibility is preserved. DEV-229's local entry point is
`mix workstream.run`; see [Local workstreams](docs/local-workstreams.md) for
versioned definitions, Linux bootstrap, passing/failing demos and exact commands.

Named cloud/review definitions and a bounded subscription qualification command are
available. See [worker qualification](docs/worker-qualification.md) for exact requested
settings, readiness checks, receipts and the Daybreak verification boundary.

## Factory boundaries

- Extend the existing coordinator; keep one writer per task and reconcile before retrying.
- Dispatch only explicitly delegated eligible Rig issues, preserving their human owner.
- Bind validation and review to exact revisions. Agent claims alone do not satisfy gates.
- Keep cloud implementation and review agents separate. The development subagent setting
  in `AGENTS.md` does not choose production factory models.
- Retain private, redacted evidence after workspace deletion. Keep Coverage Factory's
  independent qualification and scoring responsibilities in that project.
- GCP deployment and roughly twelve combined cloud/review slots are planned and require
  qualification. A build, configuration file or Terraform plan is not a live deployment.


Trusted candidate validation is available locally through the pinned-policy runner and
inline stage gates. See [trusted validation](docs/trusted-validation.md) for development/final commands, evidence and limits.

## Upstream and license

This fork builds on [OpenAI Symphony](https://github.com/openai/symphony).
The upstream [demo](https://player.vimeo.com/video/1186371009?h=5626e4b899) illustrates
Symphony's original workflow; it is not evidence of this factory's readiness.
